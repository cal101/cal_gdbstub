# cal_gdbstub - gdb stub for ESP8266 SOC

This library gets linked to a firmware running on
an ESP8266 micro controller to allow remote debugging.

For details on remote debugging with gdb see: 
[gdb remote debugging](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Debugging.html#Remote-Debugging)

I don't consider the source code to be ready for publishing.
The current state is nevertheless usable for me to some degree and so it may be for others.

If you find issues or want to suggest enhancements feal free to open an issue on this repository.

If you want to ask questions or discuss things please do that here: [Forum](http://www.esp8266.com/viewforum.php?f=13)
